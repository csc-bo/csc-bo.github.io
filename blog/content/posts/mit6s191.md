## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning

- After watch one of Feifei Li and Geffery Hinton's video on Youtube, I start to gain interest in DeepLearning, then I found this MIT course online that is a very comprehensive introduction for the Deep Learning which perfect for beginners like myself. This blog post marks the beginning of my journey into the world of machine learning, serving as a collection for my course notes and insights from related materials.

## 2. Course Content

1. **Leture 1: Introductin**
    - The Perceptron
        1. Perceptron: Simplified
            ![perceptron](/MIT6.S191/perceptron.png)
            * **Activation Functions** is to introduce **non-linearites** into the network
                * Sigmoid
                * Hyperbolic Tangent
                * Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU)
                * We can implement this graph on code very easily
            * **One perceptron**: Draws a line to separate data. binary classification.
            * **Multiple perceptrons** in layers: Can create complex curves and shapes to separate data
            * What does it do?
            Essentially, a perceptron learns a linear decision boundary that separates the input space into two regions, each corresponding to a different class.            
        2. **Forward Propagation/Forward Pass**:

             refers to the calculation and storage of intermediate variables (including outputs) for a neural network in order from the input to the output layer.


    - The Neural Networks
        1. Neural Network: 
            Stacking Perceptrons to form neural network
            ![SLNN](/MIT6.S191/SLNN.png)
            * -> MLP: Multi Layer Perceptron
        2. **Loss**: 
            The **loss** of our network measures the cost incurred from incorrect 

            * Empirical Loss

                The empirical loss measures the total loss over our entire dataset. Also know as Objective function, Cost function, Empirical Risk
                $$
                J(W) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(f(x_i;W),y_i)
                $$

            * Binary Cross Entropy Loos
                $$
                J(W) = - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(f(x_i;W)) + (1-y_i) log(1-f(x_i;W))
                $$
                
            * Mean Squared Error Loss
                $$
                J(W) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i;W))^2
                 $$

            3. **Loss Optimization**
                
                - $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                    W^* = \arg \mathop{min}\limits_{W} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(f(x_i;W),y_i)\\
                    W^* = \arg \mathop{min}\limits_{W} J(W)\\
                    \text {Where as: } W=\{W_0, W_1, ...\}
                    \end{aligned}
                $$

                - We want to **find** the network weights that achieve the **lowest loss**
                - Our loss is a function of the network weights
                - We can use gradient descent to find the weights that minimize the loss

            4. **Gradient Descent**

                1. Initialize weights randomly $\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$
                2. Loop until convergence
                3. &nbsp;&nbsp; Compute gradients, $ \frac{\partial J(W)}{\partial W}$
                4. &nbsp;&nbsp; Update weights: $ W \leftarrow W - \eta \frac{\partial J(W)}{\partial W}$
                5. Return weights

                - **Backpropagation**: 

                    Backpropagation is the application of gradient descent in deep learning, used to compute gradients of weights in neural networks. It employs the **chain rule** from calculus to efficiently propagate errors backwards, guiding updates to each layer's parameters. By calculating the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to every weight, it determines how each weight should be adjusted to minimize the loss.


                - **Learning Rate**

                    Momentum or Adaptive Learning Rates: For improved convergence, incorporate momentum or adaptive learning rate techniques like Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), RMSprop, or Adam.

                - **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**

                    Instead of using all data points at once, use a mini-batch of B data points to compute the gradient. This reduces the computational cost and improves convergence.
                    $$
                        \frac{\partial J(W)}{\partial W} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^{B} \frac{\partial J_k(W)}{\partial W}\\
                    $$
                    $$
                        \text {Then update weights: }W \leftarrow W - \eta \frac{\partial J(W)}{\partial W}
                    $$
                    - More accurate estimation of gradient
                    - Allow for larger learning rates
                    - Smoother convergence
                    - Fast training! Can parallelize computation and achieve significant speed increases on GPU's
                3. **Optimization Algorithm**
                    * SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent)
                    * Adam
                    * Adadelta
                    * Adagrad
                    * RMSProp


            
        3. **Real World Technique** 
            1. Mini-batches
            2. **Fitting**
                * Underfitting: Model does not have capacity to fully learn the data
                * Ideal fit
                * Overfitting: Too complex, extra parameters, does not generalize well
            3. **Regularization**: Improve generalization of our model on unseen data
                1. **Dropout**
                    During training, randomly set some activations to 0
                    * Typically 'drop' 50% of activations in layer
                    * Forces network to not rely on any 1 node

                        ![dropout](/MIT6.S191/dropout.png)

                2. **Early Stopping**

                    * Stop training before we have a chance to overfit
                    ![earlystopping](/MIT6.S191/earlystopping.png)

2. **Leture 2: Deep Sequence Modeling**
    - I'm gonna write this note in a more practical way, and from my SDE perspective. Code is nessesary for me to understand the concept.
    - Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)
        - Many to One: Sentiment Classification

        ![alt text](image.png)
        ![RNN](/MIT6.S191/RNN.png)
        ```
        class myRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
            def __init__(self, rnn_units, input_dim, output_dim):
                super(myRNNCell, self).__init__()

                # Initialize weight matrices
                self.W_xh = self.add_weight([rnn_units, input_dim])
                self.W_hh = self.add_weight([rnn_units, rnn_units])
                self.W_hy = self.add_weight([output_dim, rnn_units])

                # Initialize hidden state to zeros
                self.h = tf.zeros([rnn_units, 1])
            
            def call(self, x):
                # the input x corresponds to x_t in the graph

                # Update the hidden state
                # h_t = tanh(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t)
                self.h = tf.math.tanh(  self.W_hh * self.h + self.W_xh * x)

                # Compute the output, y^hat_t = W_hy * h
                output = self.W_hy * self.h

                # Return the current output and hidden state
                return output, self.h

        # tensorflow method
        tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(rnn_units)
        ```
        - The implementation is highly identical to the graphical representation.
        - This code provided by Professor slide not complete. But we can get the idea.
        - I watched Andrej Karpathy's video, he actully only need an image to implement Neural Networks.
        - Combine the graph and code help me to understand the concept.
    - Endcoding Language for a Neural Network
        - **Embbedding**: transform indexes into a vector of fixed size.
            ![alt text](image-2.png)
        - **One-hot embedding**: 
            - One-hot embedding is a way to represent categorical data as binary vectors.
            - Each category is represented by a binary vector, where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0.
            - This representation is useful for representing categorical data, such as words in a language, where each word is represented by a unique index.

        ![alt text](image-1.png)
    - RNN Problems
        - Exploding Gradients: Many values > 1, mutiply many large numbers together lead to unstable training, oscillations in the loss function, and ultimately, the model failing to converge to a good solution.
            - Gradient clipping: A technique used to prevent exploding gradients by clipping the gradients to a maximum value.
        - Vanishing Gradients: Many values < 1, mutiply many small numbers together cause the weights to not update at all. then the bias parameters capture short-term dependencies. result no long-term dependencies.
            - Activation functions: Using ReLU prevents f' from shriking the gradients when x > 0
            - Parameter Initialization: Initializing **weights** to identity matrix, initialize **biases** to zero. this prevent the weight from shrinking to zero
            - Gated Cells: use gates to selectively add or remove information within each recurrent unit with gated cell (LSTMs, GRUs)

    - LSTMs(Long Short-Term Memory)
        - Gated LSTM cells control information flow
        - Key Concepts
            1. Maintain a **cell state**
            2. Use **gates** to control the **flow of information**
                - **Forget** gate gets rid of irrelevant information
                - **Store** relevent information from current input
                - Selectively **update** cell state
                - **Output** gate returns a filtered version of the cell state
            3. Backpropagation through time with partially **uninterrupted gradient flow**
    - Limitations of RNNs
        - Encoding bottleneck
        - Slow, no parallelization
        - Not long memory

    - Attention is all you need(transformer)
        - Attention mechanism: orignal from a paper of RNN, this is like RNN search. Allow network to search relevant information
        - Self-Attention: identify and attend to most important features in input
            1. Encode position information
            2. Extract query, key, value for search
            3. Comput attention weighting
            4. Extract Features with high attention
            These steps form a self-attention head that plug into a larger network. Each head attends to a different part of the input.
