# Binary_tree

- type of tree:

  - AST
  - Balanced Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree

- traverse binary tree:

  - preorder
  - inorder
  - postorder

- traverse method:

  - recursive
  - iterativ

- search method:

  - depth first search(DFS)
  - breadth first search(BFS)

- find hight/depth:

  - BFS, level order traversal
