      <description>1. Introduction to Deep Learning After watch one of Feifei Li and Geffery Hinton&amp;rsquo;s video on Youtube, I start to gain interest in DeepLearning, then I found this MIT course online that is a very comprehensive introduction for the Deep Learning which perfect for beginners like myself. This blog post marks the beginning of my journey into the world of machine learning, serving as a collection for my course notes and insights from related materials.</description>
